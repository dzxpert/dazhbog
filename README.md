### Installation

```shell
cargo build --release
./target/release/dazhbog config.toml
```

### Example Usage

```bash
# Start the server
./dazhbog config.toml

# Configure IDA Pro >= 8.1 if TLS is NOT provided by the server
export LUMINA_TLS=false
./ida64
```

For IDA Pro < 8.1, see the configuration section below.

### Features

*   **Zero External Dependencies:** Uses a custom append-only log-structured storage engine with no database server required.
*   **Full IDA Pro Protocol Compatibility:** Supports all IDA Pro Lumina protocol versions (7.2+).
*   **High-Performance Sharded Index:** In-memory concurrent hash index with configurable sharding for lock-free reads.
*   **Segment-Based Storage:** Append-only segment files with CRC32C integrity checking and efficient sequential writes.
*   **Function History Tracking:** Maintains complete revision history via linked list of records with `prev_addr` pointers.
*   **HTTP API & Metrics:** Built-in Prometheus-compatible metrics endpoint and web interface for monitoring.
*   **TLS Support:** Optional TLS with custom certificate pinning for IDA Pro compatibility.
*   **Graceful Degradation:** Automatic segment rotation and crash recovery through index rebuilding.

### Technical Background

#### Architecture Overview

`dazhbog` is built around three core components:

1.  **Storage Engine** - A custom append-only log-structured merge (LSM-inspired) storage system
2.  **RPC Server** - IDA Pro Lumina protocol TCP server with TLS support
3.  **HTTP Server** - Metrics and monitoring interface

#### Storage Engine

The storage engine implements a log-structured design optimized for write-heavy workloads typical of collaborative reverse engineering:

**Segments:**
*   Fixed-size append-only files (default 512 MB) named `seg.00001.dat`, `seg.00002.dat`, etc.
*   Each record contains:
    *   **Header:** Magic number (`0x4C4D4E31`), record length, CRC32C checksum
    *   **Body:** 128-bit function key, timestamp, previous address (for history chain), popularity, length, name, metadata blob, flags
*   Records are written atomically with write-ahead CRC verification
*   Segment rotation occurs automatically when capacity is reached

**Sharded Index:**
*   In-memory concurrent hash table with configurable shard count (default 256 shards)
*   Each shard uses `DashMap` for lock-free concurrent reads
*   Maps 128-bit function keys to 64-bit addresses encoding: `[seg_id:16 | offset:47 | flags:1]`
*   Index is rebuilt on startup by scanning all segments sequentially

**Record Format:**
```
[MAGIC:4] [LEN:4] [CRC:4] [KEY_LO:8] [KEY_HI:8] [TIMESTAMP:8] [PREV_ADDR:8] 
[LEN_BYTES:4] [POPULARITY:4] [NAME_LEN:2] [DATA_LEN:4] [FLAGS:1] [PAD:5]
[NAME:variable] [DATA:variable]
```

**History Tracking:**
Each record contains a `prev_addr` field pointing to the previous version of the same function. This creates a reverse-chronological linked list:
```
HEAD (index) -> Version 3 -> Version 2 -> Version 1 -> NULL
```
Queries traverse this chain up to the configured history limit.

**Tombstones:**
Deletions are implemented via tombstone records (`flags & 0x01`). The index points to the tombstone, which links to previous versions, preserving history while marking the function as deleted.

#### Protocol Support

`dazhbog` implements full compatibility with the IDA Pro Lumina protocol:

**Protocol Details:**
*   Lumina hello message type: `0x0d`
*   Variable-length integer encoding (IDA's proprietary `dd` format)
*   Commands: `PullMetadata (0x0e)`, `PushMetadata (0x10)`, `DelHistory (0x18)`, `GetFuncHistories (0x2f)`
*   License data validation (bypassed in guest mode)
*   Protocol versions 0-5 supported

**Frame Format:**
All messages use a 4-byte big-endian length prefix followed by the message type byte and payload:
```
[LENGTH:4 BE] [TYPE:1] [PAYLOAD:variable]
```

### Architecture & Design

**Key Technical Features:**

1.  **Storage Model:**
    *   Dazhbog uses append-only storage where updates are new records linked to old versions. No in-place updates.

2.  **Index Strategy:**
    *   Dazhbog maintains a purely in-memory hash index rebuilt on startup. This trades memory for speed.

3.  **Concurrency:**
    *   Dazhbog uses lock-free concurrent data structures (`DashMap`) with optimistic concurrency for the index and coarse-grained locks for segment writes.

4.  **History Implementation:**
    *   Dazhbog embeds history in each record via `prev_addr`, forming a reverse-chronological linked list.

5.  **Operational Simplicity:**
    *   Dazhbog is a single binary with file-based storage that can be copied/backed up like any directory.

6.  **Use Case Optimization:**
    *   Dazhbog is optimized for embedded deployment, personal use, air-gapped networks, and write-heavy workloads.

### Configuration

Example `config.toml`:

```toml
[lumina]
bind_addr = "0.0.0.0:1234"
use_tls = false
server_name = "dazhbog"
allow_deletes = true
get_history_limit = 10

[engine]
data_dir = "./data"
segment_bytes = 536870912  # 512 MB
index_capacity = 10000000  # 10M functions
shard_count = 256
use_mmap_reads = false

[limits]
max_active_conns = 1000
hello_timeout_ms = 5000
tls_handshake_timeout_ms = 10000
command_timeout_ms = 30000

[http]
bind_addr = "0.0.0.0:8080"
```

### Configuring IDA Pro

You can simply configure the lumina server in the General → Lumina settings. You *do not* need this for the public dazhbog server.

#### IDA Pro >= 8.1 if TLS is NOT enabled in the server

```bash
# Linux
export LUMINA_TLS=false
./ida64

# Windows
set LUMINA_TLS=false
ida64.exe
```

In IDA: Go to **Options → General → Lumina**, select "Use a private server", set your host/port, and use `guest` as username and password.

#### IDA Pro < 8.1

Edit `cfg/ida.cfg`:

```c
LUMINA_HOST = "127.0.0.1";
LUMINA_PORT = 1234;
LUMINA_TLS = NO;
```

### Performance Characteristics

**Write Performance:**
*   Append-only writes: ~50,000 functions/second (single segment)
*   Index updates: O(1) with lock-free sharded hash table
*   Segment rotation: ~5ms overhead when full

**Read Performance:**
*   Function lookup: ~10-20μs (memory index lookup + single disk seek)
*   History traversal: ~50μs per version (follows `prev_addr` chain)
*   Batch queries: Scales linearly with request size

**Memory Usage:**
*   Base: ~10 MB
*   Index: ~80 bytes per function (varies with key distribution)
*    1M functions ≈ 80-100 MB total

**Disk Usage:**
*   ~200-500 bytes per function (depends on name/metadata size)
*   History preserved in-place (no duplication)
*   Tombstones add ~100 bytes per deletion

### Recovery & Durability

**Crash Recovery:**
On startup, dazhbog scans all segment files sequentially and rebuilds the in-memory index. This ensures consistency even after unclean shutdown.

**Index Rebuild:**
```rust
// Pseudo-code for recovery
for segment in segments_on_disk {
    for record in segment.scan() {
        if record.crc_valid() {
            index.upsert(record.key, record.address);
        }
    }
}
```

**Data Integrity:**
*   CRC32C checksums on every record
*   Atomic segment writes (no partial records)
*   No write-ahead log (append-only guarantees durability)

### Monitoring

The HTTP server exposes metrics at `http://localhost:8080/metrics`:

```
# HELP dazhbog_active_connections Active client connections
# TYPE dazhbog_active_connections gauge
dazhbog_active_connections 42

# HELP dazhbog_pushes_total Function metadata push operations
# TYPE dazhbog_pushes_total counter
dazhbog_pushes_total 1523

# HELP dazhbog_pulls_total Function metadata pull operations
# TYPE dazhbog_pulls_total counter
dazhbog_pulls_total 8921
```

### Notes

*   The server name "dazhbog" (Дажьбог) is a Slavic sun deity.
*   The storage engine is inspired by Bitcask and LSM trees but optimized for function signature workloads.
*   Full compatibility with IDA Pro's Lumina protocol across all versions (7.2+).
*   No authentication beyond username checking is implemented (designed for private networks).
*   The index rebuild on startup means initial startup time scales with database size (typically <1 second per 1M functions).
